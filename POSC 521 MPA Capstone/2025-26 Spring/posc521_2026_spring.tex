\section*{Detailed Course Requirements}

\subsection*{1) Weekly Readings Assignment}

\textbf{Important Note:} Beginning in Week 2, all students are required to include copies of their feedback (AI or approved alternative) as an \emph{appendix} to their final weekly submission. Feedback is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Required} for final synthesis papers every week.
    \item \textbf{Optional} for annotated bibliographies after Week 4.
\end{itemize}

The capstone course is designed to integrate key theories and practices in public administration through weekly assignments culminating in a comprehensive capstone synthesis paper. Students will engage with foundational readings, participate in in-person discussions, and produce critical analyses that connect theory to practice.

\subsubsection*{Weekly Assignment Workflow (Weeks 2--9)}

Each week includes the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Annotated Bibliography (5 points; Due Monday Before Class)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Prepare for in-class discussion by summarizing key ideas and evaluating the relevance of assigned readings.
        \item \textbf{Instructions}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For each assigned reading:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Provide a citation in APA or Chicago author-date style.
                \item Write a 150-word annotation that includes:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item A brief summary of the central argument and key points.
                    \item Relevance to the week's topic and implications for public administration.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Feedback Appendix (Weeks 2--4 Required; Week 5+ Optional; Diagnostic Only)}: Students may use tools such as OpenAI's \href{https://chat.openai.com/}{ChatGPT}, Anthropic's \href{https://www.anthropic.com/}{Claude}, Google's \href{https://www.google.com/search/about/}{Gemini}, or the university's \href{https://titangpt.fullerton.edu/auth/jwt/login}{TitanGPT} to request critique. Approved alternatives (peer feedback or a structured self-critique) are acceptable with prior notice. The appendix is for \textbf{reflection and improvement next week}, not for AI-assisted rewriting.

            \item \textbf{AI Use Boundary}: You may use AI to \textbf{check accuracy}, \textbf{identify missing concepts}, and \textbf{suggest a discussion question}. You may \textbf{not} use AI to draft, rewrite, or polish your annotation text. The submitted annotation must be written by you.

            \item \textbf{Sample Prompt (optional)}:
            \begin{quote}
                \texttt{You are my writing coach for a graduate PA seminar. Please review one annotated bibliography entry. Check for accuracy of the summary, clarity of the relevance statement, and any missing concepts from the reading. Return: (1) 3 bullet critiques, (2) 1 suggestion for improvement, and (3) 1 discussion question. Do not rewrite my text or propose replacement sentences.}
            \end{quote}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Rough Draft Synthesis Paper (10 points; Due Monday Before Class)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Develop an initial critical analysis integrating insights from the readings to facilitate in-class discussion.
        \item \textbf{Instructions}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Write a 3-page rough draft synthesis paper that:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Identifies patterns, connections, and contradictions across the readings.
                \item Highlights implications for public administration theory and practice.
            \end{itemize}
    
            \item \textbf{No AI Assistance (Rough Draft)}: This draft must be written entirely by you without AI tools (no drafting, rewriting, outlining, summarizing, or editing assistance). The goal is to capture your independent reading and thinking to support Monday’s discussion.
    
            \item This draft will be refined based on \textbf{class discussion}, the \textbf{in-class peer review studio}, and \textbf{your own reflection} (not AI feedback).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{In-Person Class Discussion and Peer Review Studio (Monday)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Purpose}: Deepen understanding of the week's readings through collaborative discussion and refine synthesis thinking.
            \item \textbf{Activity}: Analyze key themes, patterns, and contradictions in the readings; discuss insights from rough drafts.
            \item \textbf{Peer Review Studio (30 minutes)}: Students work in rotating pairs to give targeted feedback using a short checklist. Each student shares two actionable suggestions and one question with their partner by the end of class.
        \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Final Synthesis Paper (20 points; Due Wednesday Night)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Produce a polished critical analysis incorporating insights from class discussion.
    \item \textbf{Instructions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write a 4- to 5-page final synthesis paper that:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Refines and expands the rough draft based on \textbf{class discussion} and the \textbf{in-class peer review studio} (not AI feedback).
            \item Demonstrates sophisticated integration of readings with deeper analysis.
            \item Connects theory to practice in public administration.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Feedback Appendix (Required; Diagnostic Only)}: Attach an appendix containing feedback you gathered this week. \textbf{AI feedback is recommended} as a critical review tool; approved alternatives (peer feedback or structured self-critique) are acceptable with prior notice. The appendix is for \textbf{reflection and improvement next week}, not for revising this submission.

        \item \textbf{AI Use Boundary}: You may use AI to \textbf{identify strengths, gaps, counterarguments, and cross-reading connections}. You may \textbf{not} use AI to draft, rewrite, or revise any part of the Week 5 final paper. Apply AI feedback to your \textbf{next} synthesis instead.

        \item Suggested AI prompt (optional):
        \begin{quote}
            \texttt{Act as a critical reviewer for my synthesis paper. Identify 3 strengths, 3 gaps in reasoning or evidence, 2 counterarguments I should address, and 2 additional connections across readings. Do not rewrite my paper or propose replacement text.}
        \end{quote}

        \item Include \textbf{all feedback collected} during the week (AI, peer, and/or self-critique) in the appendix, along with a brief \textbf{Next-Week Plan} (5--7 bullets) describing what you will do differently in the next synthesis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Personal Reflection (10 points; Due Friday Night)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Purpose}: Consolidate learning and reflect on how your thinking evolved across the week's work.
            \item \textbf{Instructions}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Write a brief personal reflection (250--300 words) on your learning process and insights gained from the week's work.
                \item Focus on what changed in your understanding after discussion/peer review, and what you would do differently next week.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Week 1 Alternative Assignment (MLK Week)}

        \item A 300-word reflection identifying one tension you see between traditional PA approaches and the New Public Service approach.
        \item Two discussion questions to bring to Week 2.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Due}: Friday, 1/23 by 11:59 p.m.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Book Deep-Dive Alternative (Weeks 6 and 9)}

% ========== SECTION 7: ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ==========
\section*{Academic Integrity}
Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity. Any student found to have engaged in academic dishonesty will be subject to the sanctions described in the \href{https://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf}{Academic Dishonesty Policy} (UPS 300.021). Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, and submitting previously graded work without prior authorization. Students are expected to be familiar with the university's policy on academic dishonesty and to adhere to this policy in all aspects of this course. Any student who has questions about the policy should ask the professor for clarification.

\subsection*{Plagiarism}
Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity and will not be tolerated in this course. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, copying and pasting text from sources without proper citation, paraphrasing text from sources without proper citation, and submitting work that is not your own. Students are expected to properly cite all sources used in their work and to submit original work. Failure to do so may result in a failing grade for the assignment and further disciplinary action.

\subsection*{Written Work}
All written work must be submitted in a professional format, including proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Written work must also be properly cited using the appropriate citation style. Students are expected to follow the guidelines for written work provided by the professor and to seek clarification if they have questions about the requirements.

% ========== SECTION 8A: POLICY ON THE USE OF GENERATIVE AI AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY ==========
\section*{Policy on the Use of Generative AI and Other Technology}

\subsubsection*{Definition of Generative AI}

\noindent For this course, generative AI refers to systems capable of producing human-like text, images, data analysis, or other content. Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, TitanGPT)
    \item Text-to-image or multimodal generators (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)
    \item AI writing assistants and summarizers
    \item Automated coding, data, or content generators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{AI Use Policy}

AI is permitted and encouraged as a learning tool \textit{within strict boundaries}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Not Allowed (Rough Drafts)}: The \textbf{initial/rough draft} for major writing assignments must be written entirely by you with \textbf{no AI assistance} (no outlining, summarizing, drafting, rewriting, or editing).
    \item \textbf{Allowed (Diagnostic Critique)}: On assignments that include a \textbf{Feedback Appendix}, you may use AI to \textbf{critique} your work (identify strengths, gaps, counterarguments, and cross-reading connections).
    \item \textbf{Not Allowed}: Using AI to \textbf{draft, rewrite, or polish} any portion of submitted work.
    \item \textbf{Assignment-Specific Rule}: If the appendix is labeled \textbf{Diagnostic Only}, the AI feedback may \textbf{not} be used to revise the same-week submission; it is to improve \textbf{future} work.
    \item \textbf{Required in specific assignments}: Where a feedback appendix is required, include AI feedback or an approved alternative (peer feedback or structured self-critique).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rationale for AI Policy}

This policy is designed to ensure AI use strengthens---not substitutes---your academic work:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Promotes critical engagement with public administration theory by using AI as a feedback partner.
    \item Enhances literature review and writing by highlighting missing connections or blind spots.
    \item Builds professional literacy with tools already common in public service organizations.
    \item Develops ethical judgment by practicing responsible use of emerging technologies.
    \item Encourages sustainability awareness in balancing AI's benefits with its environmental costs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Ethics and Responsible Use}

\noindent Students are expected to engage with AI responsibly:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authorship}: All submitted prose must be written by you. AI may provide critique, but may not generate or rewrite your sentences, paragraphs, or structure.
    \item \textbf{Attribution}: When AI feedback is used (where permitted), include it in the \textbf{Feedback Appendix} with the tool name and date (e.g., ``ChatGPT critique, 2/18/26''). Do not treat AI text as source material to incorporate into your writing.
    \item \textbf{Bias Awareness}: AI outputs reflect biases. Evaluate them critically for fairness and accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Verification}: Validate AI-suggested facts or sources before using them in your work.
    \item \textbf{Confidentiality}: Do not upload sensitive, private, or proprietary information into AI tools.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability}: Be mindful of AI's environmental footprint and use tools thoughtfully.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Repercussions for Misuse}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Misuse includes submitting AI-generated work as your own, failing to cite AI contributions, or relying on AI instead of demonstrating your own analysis.
    \item Consequences may include revision requirements, grade penalties, or formal academic integrity proceedings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Assessment of AI Use}

AI use will be evaluated by boundaries and learning, not polish:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compliance with assignment-specific AI rules (e.g., \textbf{no AI on rough drafts}).
    \item Quality of the \textbf{Feedback Appendix} when required (useful critique + evidence you understood it).
    \item A brief \textbf{Next-Step Plan} showing how you will apply critique to \textbf{future} work.
    \item Quality of class participation and in-class writing/discussion, demonstrating independent engagement with readings and theory.
    \item Final projects that demonstrate original analysis and a consistent authorial voice.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The goal is to treat AI as a \textit{feedback partner}---a tool to sharpen your analysis, deepen your questions, and strengthen your voice in public administration. If you cannot explain and defend your argument, evidence choices, and revisions without external support, then the work does not meet the course standard.
