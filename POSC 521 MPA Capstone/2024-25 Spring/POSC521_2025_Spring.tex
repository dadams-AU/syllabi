\subsection*{Artificial Intelligence Policy}
\subsubsection*{Definitions of Generative AI}

\noindent For the purposes of this course, generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of producing human-like text, images, or other content. This includes, but is not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Large language models (LLM) (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4)
    \item Text-to-image generators (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)
    \item AI-powered writing assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)
    \item Automated content generators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{AI Use Policy}

In this course, the use of AI is permitted and encouraged as a learning tool, with the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Allowed}: Using AI for feedback on annotated bibliographies and syntheses, as outlined in the assignment.
    \item \textbf{Allowed}: Using AI for the reflection activity.
    \item \textbf{Not Allowed}: Submitting AI-generated content as your own work without substantial human input and critical analysis.
    \item \textbf{Not Mandatory}: The use of AI is optional. Students are not required to use AI tools if they prefer not to.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rationale for AI Policy}

This AI policy is designed to align with our course objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It supports the examination of public administration theories by encouraging critical engagement with AI feedback.
    \item It enhances literature review skills by allowing AI to provide additional perspectives on annotations and syntheses.
    \item It improves writing skills by providing an additional source of feedback and encouraging revision.
    \item It fosters critical thinking by requiring students to evaluate and incorporate AI feedback thoughtfully.
    \item It contributes to professional development by familiarizing students with AI tools they may encounter in their public administration careers.
    \item It promotes awareness of ethical considerations and sustainability impacts associated with AI use.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Ethics and Sustainability Considerations}

\noindent Students are expected to engage with AI tools ethically and responsibly. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ethical Use}: Avoid using AI to plagiarize or produce content without proper attribution. Cite AI tools as sources when they contribute to your work.
    \item \textbf{Bias Awareness}: Understand that AI tools can reflect and perpetuate biases present in their training data. Critically evaluate the outputs for fairness and inclusivity.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability Impact}: Be mindful of the environmental impact of AI, including the carbon emissions associated with large-scale model training and inference. Use AI judiciously and consider alternative methods when feasible.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Guidance for Students on AI Use}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When using AI for feedback, always cite it as a source. For example: ``ChatGPT (Version X.X) [AI model]. OpenAI. Feedback received on [Date].''
    \item Be critical of AI-generated content. AI can make mistakes or provide biased information.
    \item Use AI as a tool to enhance your learning, not as a substitute for your own critical thinking and analysis.
    \item We will discuss ethical AI use, sustainability impacts, and its implications for public administration during our course.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Repercussions for Policy Breaches}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suspected misuse of AI (e.g., submitting AI-generated content as your own without proper attribution) will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
    \item Detection methods may include inconsistencies in writing style, unusual phrasing, or content that doesn't align with the student's demonstrated knowledge and skills.
    \item Consequences for policy breaches may range from a required revision of the assignment to more severe academic integrity penalties, such as dismissal from the MPA program, depending on the nature and extent of the misuse.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Remember, the goal of this policy is to enhance your learning experience and prepare you for a future where AI will likely play a significant role in public administration. Use these tools responsibly and ethically to support your academic and professional growth.

\subsubsection*{Goals and Assessment of AI Use}

\noindent The goals for AI use in this course are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To teach students to use AI as a complementary tool for enhancing critical thinking and writing skills.
    \item To prepare students for professional environments where AI tools are increasingly common in public administration.
    \item To encourage critical evaluation of AI-generated feedback and content.
    \item To foster ethical and responsible use of AI in academic and professional settings.
    \item To promote sustainability awareness by considering the environmental costs of AI use.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Assessment of these goals and overall learning objectives will be conducted through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison of initial drafts with AI-assisted revisions
    \item Analysis of student reflections on the learning process
    \item Evaluation of class participation and discussions
    \item Periodic comparative assignments (with and without AI assistance)
    \item Review of AI usage logs
    \item Assessment of peer review quality
    \item Comprehensive final project or exam
    \item Professional development reflection on future AI use in public administration
\end{itemize}

\noindent These assessment methods will help ensure that AI use is enhancing, rather than replacing, critical thinking and analytical skills essential to public administration.

\subsection*{2) Reading Discussion Facilitation}
Students will be responsible for facilitating the discussion of the assigned readings each week, for Weeks 3 through 9. This can be done individually or in pairs. The facilitators will lead the class in a discussion of the readings, pose questions to stimulate critical thinking and analysis, and encourage active participation from all students. The facilitators will also provide a brief summary of the readings and highlight the key points for discussion. The facilitators will be selected at the beginning of the semester, and the schedule will be posted on \emph{Canvas}. The facilitators will be graded based on the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Preparation: The facilitators are well-prepared and have a thorough understanding of the readings.
    \item Engagement: The facilitators actively engage the class in discussion and encourage participation from all students.
    \item Critical Thinking: The facilitators pose thought-provoking questions and stimulate critical thinking and analysis.
    \item Communication: The facilitators communicate clearly and effectively, ensuring that all students understand the key points of the readings.
    \item Leadership: The facilitators lead the discussion in a professional and respectful manner, creating a positive learning environment.
    \item Participation: The facilitators actively participate in the discussion and contribute to the class's understanding of the readings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3) MPA Comprehensive General Area Essay Exam}

Students will complete a comprehensive general area essay exam as part of the MPA program's comprehensive exam requirement. The exam will consist of two questions from which students will choose one to answer. The questions will be based on the course readings and discussions and will require students to demonstrate their understanding of public administration's key concepts, theories, and debates. The exam will allow students to synthesize their learning in the course and demonstrate their ability to think critically and write clearly about complex issues in public administration. Students who do not pass the exam on the first attempt will have the opportunity to retake the exam once during finals week. The grade for the exam is pass/fail. Students who do not pass on the second attempt will be required to retake the course.

\subsection*{4) Concentration Area Writing Project}
