\subsection*{Artificial Intelligence Policy}

\subsubsection*{Definition of Generative AI}

\noindent For this course, generative AI refers to systems capable of producing human-like text, images, data analysis, or other content. Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, TitanGPT)
    \item Text-to-image or multimodal generators (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney)
    \item AI writing assistants and summarizers
    \item Automated coding, data, or content generators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{AI Use Policy}

AI is permitted and encouraged as a learning tool, under the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Allowed}: Using AI for feedback on annotated bibliographies, synthesis drafts, and reflections (see assignments for sample prompts).
    \item \textbf{Allowed}: Using AI to brainstorm questions, highlight gaps, or check clarity and organization.
    \item \textbf{Not Allowed}: Submitting AI-generated text as your own work or asking AI to rewrite your assignments.
    \item \textbf{Optional}: Students may choose whether or not to use AI tools for any assignment in this course. All work can be completed successfully without AI assistance. This optional approach applies to all course requirements, regardless of specific AI-related instructions in individual assignments.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rationale for AI Policy}

This policy is designed to ensure AI use strengthens—not substitutes—your academic work:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Promotes critical engagement with public administration theory by using AI as a feedback partner.
    \item Enhances literature review and writing by highlighting missing connections or blind spots.
    \item Builds professional literacy with tools already common in public service organizations.
    \item Develops ethical judgment by practicing responsible use of emerging technologies.
    \item Encourages sustainability awareness in balancing AI's benefits with its environmental costs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Ethics and Responsible Use}

\noindent Students are expected to engage with AI responsibly:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authorship}: All substantive writing must be your own. AI may provide critique, but not draft or rewrite.
    \item \textbf{Citation}: When AI meaningfully informs your work, cite it (e.g., ``ChatGPT (GPT-5) [AI model], feedback received [date]``).
    \item \textbf{Bias Awareness}: AI outputs reflect biases. Evaluate them critically for fairness and accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Sustainability}: Be mindful of AI's environmental footprint and use tools thoughtfully.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Repercussions for Misuse}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Misuse includes submitting AI-generated work as your own, failing to cite AI contributions, or relying on AI instead of demonstrating your own analysis.
    \item Consequences may include revision requirements, grade penalties, or formal academic integrity proceedings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Assessment of AI Use}

AI use will be assessed not by how often you use it, but by how thoughtfully you integrate it into your learning:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evidence of revision and improvement based on AI or peer feedback.
    \item Student reflections on the usefulness and limitations of AI.
    \item Quality of class participation, showing independent engagement with readings and theory.
    \item Final projects that demonstrate original critical thinking, even if AI supported the drafting process.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The goal is to treat AI as a \textit{feedback partner}---a tool to sharpen your analysis, deepen your questions, and strengthen your voice in public administration.


\section{Course Requirements}

\subsection*{1) Weekly Readings Assignment}

\textbf{Important Note:} Beginning in Week 1, all students are required to include copies of their AI feedback as an \emph{appendix} to their final weekly submission. AI feedback is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Required} for final synthesis papers every week.
    \item \textbf{Optional} for annotated bibliographies after Week 3.
\end{itemize}

The capstone course is designed to integrate key theories and practices in public administration through weekly assignments culminating in a comprehensive capstone synthesis paper. Students will engage with foundational readings, participate in in-person discussions, and produce critical analyses that connect theory to practice.

\subsubsection*{Weekly Assignment Workflow}

Each week includes the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Annotated Bibliography (Due Monday Before Class)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Prepare for in-class discussion by summarizing key ideas and evaluating the relevance of assigned readings.

                    \item A brief summary of the central argument and key points.
                    \item Relevance to the week's topic and implications for public administration.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Optional AI Feedback (Weeks 1--3 Required; Week 4+ Optional)}: Students may use tools such as OpenAI's \href{https://chat.openai.com/}{ChatGPT}, Anthropic's \href{https://www.anthropic.com/}{Claude}, Google's \href{https://www.google.com/search/about/}{Gemini}, or the university's \href{https://titangpt.fullerton.edu/auth/jwt/login}{TitanGPT} to request feedback.  
            \item \textbf{Sample Prompt}:
            \begin{quote}
                \texttt{``Here is my annotated bibliography entry. Citation: [insert citation]. Summary: [insert summary]. Relevance: [insert relevance]. Please give me feedback on clarity and accuracy, and suggest 1--2 questions I could raise in class.''}

                \item Highlights implications for public administration theory and practice.
            \end{itemize}
            \item This draft should be substantive but will be refined based on class discussion and further reflection.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{In-Person Class Discussion (Tuesday)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Deepen understanding of the week's readings through collaborative discussion and refine synthesis thinking.
        \item \textbf{Activity}: Analyze key themes, patterns, and contradictions in the readings; discuss insights from rough drafts.
        \item \textbf{Special Workshops}: In Weeks 3, 6, and 9, class will include structured peer review workshops in addition to regular discussion.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Final Synthesis Paper \& Reflection (Due Friday Night)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Produce a polished critical analysis incorporating insights from class discussion.
        \item \textbf{Instructions}:

            \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{AI Feedback (Required)}: Students must use an AI tool for feedback and copy/paste the AI response into the appendix of their final submission.  
            \begin{quote}
                \texttt{``I've drafted a synthesis paper that integrates [number] readings on [topic]. Please identify strengths and gaps in my analysis, and suggest additional connections I could make. Do not rewrite the paper.''}
            \end{quote}
            \item Write a brief personal reflection on your learning process and insights gained from the week's work.
            \item Include all AI feedback used during the week in an appendix.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{3) Reading Discussion Facilitation}

Students will facilitate class discussions in pairs for Weeks 2 through 9 (skipping Week 1). With 9 students, most weeks will have facilitator pairs, with one week requiring a group of three. Facilitators will lead integrated discussions that build on their collaborative preparation and the rough draft synthesis papers submitted prior to class, creating a dynamic learning environment that bridges individual preparation with collaborative analysis.

\subsubsection*{Facilitator Responsibilities}

\textbf{Pre-Class Preparation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaborate with your partner(s) to share and discuss your annotated bibliographies, identifying complementary perspectives and areas of disagreement
    \item Prepare 6--8 discussion questions that connect readings to broader public administration theory and practice
    \item Design activities that encourage synthesis across readings and connection to current events or case studies
    \item Divide facilitation responsibilities and plan your collaborative approach
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Class Facilitation (45 minutes):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Opening synthesis (10 minutes):} Collaboratively present key themes and tensions across the week's readings, drawing on your joint analysis
    \item \textbf{Facilitated discussion (25 minutes):} Guide analysis through prepared questions, ensuring all students contribute and connecting individual insights from rough drafts
    \item \textbf{Practical connections (10 minutes):} Lead discussion on implications for public administration practice, current policy issues, or professional scenarios
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Post-Class Reflection:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each facilitator submits an individual brief (250-word) reflection on Canvas within 24 hours, analyzing what worked well, partnership dynamics, and what insights emerged from the discussion
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Assessment Criteria}

Facilitator pairs will be evaluated on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Preparation and Collaboration:} Demonstrates thorough understanding of readings and effective partnership in synthesizing different perspectives from their joint preparation
    \item \textbf{Discussion Leadership:} Creates inclusive environment, manages extended class time effectively, and guides productive dialogue without dominating
    \item \textbf{Critical Inquiry:} Poses thought-provoking questions that push beyond summary to analysis, evaluation, and application within their 45-minute segment
    \item \textbf{Integration:} Successfully connects readings to broader course themes, current events, and professional practice in public administration
    \item \textbf{Adaptability:} Responds effectively to unexpected directions in discussion and incorporates diverse student perspectives within their facilitation time
    \item \textbf{Professional Communication:} Maintains respectful, scholarly discourse while encouraging risk-taking in thinking and effectively shares facilitation responsibilities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} Facilitator assignments will be distributed at the beginning of the semester. The instructor will handle all peer review workshop activities during designated weeks (3, 6, 9).

\subsection*{4) MPA Comprehensive General Area Essay Exam}

Students will complete a comprehensive general area essay exam as part of the MPA program's comprehensive exam requirement. The exam will consist of two questions from which students will choose one to answer. The questions will be based on the course readings and discussions and will require students to demonstrate their understanding of public administration's key concepts, theories, and debates. The exam will allow students to synthesize their learning in the course and demonstrate their ability to think critically and write clearly about complex issues in public administration. Students who do not pass the exam on the first attempt will have the opportunity to retake the exam once during finals week. The grade for the exam is pass/fail. Students who do not pass on the second attempt will be required to retake the course.

\subsection*{5) Concentration Area Writing Project}

\noindent \textit{Note: The specific focus of this project will vary depending on your concentration area (Public Finance, Human Resource Management, Local Government Management, or Public Policy). Detailed assignment sheets for each concentration provide tailored prompts and options. This syllabus outlines the shared structure, requirements, and grading criteria for all students.}

\subsubsection*{Assignment Overview}

This capstone project allows students to deepen their understanding of their MPA concentration area by integrating theoretical frameworks with real-world challenges. Using \textbf{Heather McGhee's \textit{The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together} (2021)} as a central text, students will explore how exclusionary policies and inequitable governance affect their concentration area, such as public finance, human resources, local government management, or public policy. The assignment is scaffolded into stages to guide students toward producing a polished, analytical final paper.

\paragraph*{Objectives:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop expertise in a specific public administration concentration area.
    \item Enhance research, analytical, and writing skills.
