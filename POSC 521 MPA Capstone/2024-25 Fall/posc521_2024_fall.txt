\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity.

Failure to do so may result in a failing grade for the assignment and further disciplinary action.

\section{University-wide Student Learning Outcomes}
As a capstone course in the MPA program, this course is designed to help students achieve the following university-wide student learning outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Knowledge, skills, and professional dispositions including higher order competence in disciplinary perspectives and interdisciplinary points of view;
    \item The ability to access, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate complex information from multiple sources and in new situations and settings;
    \item Advanced communication skills;
    \item The ability to work independently and in collaboration with others as artists, practitioners, researchers, and/or scholars;
    \item The ability to determine and apply appropriate methods and technologies to address problems that affect their communities; 
    \item A commitment to social justice and ethical leadership within diverse communities and an interdependent global community.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Course Requirements}

\subsection*{Annotated Bibliography, Synthesis, and Personal Reflection}
During the first eight weeks of the course, students will complete an annotated bibliography, synthesis, and personal reflection on the assigned readings. The annotated bibliography will include a summary of the critical points of each reading, an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments presented, and a reflection on the implications of the readings for public administration theory and practice. The synthesis will integrate the key points of the readings and identify common themes and divergent perspectives. The personal reflection will provide an opportunity for students to connect the readings to their own experiences and perspectives and consider the readings' implications for their future careers in public administration.

\subsection*{MPA Comprehensive General Area Essay Exam}

Students will complete a comprehensive general area essay exam as part of the MPA programâ€™s comprehensive exam requirement. The exam will consist of three questions from which students will choose one to answer. The questions will be based on the course readings and discussions and will require students to demonstrate their understanding of public administration's key concepts, theories, and debates. The exam will allow students to synthesize their learning in the course and demonstrate their ability to think critically and write clearly about complex issues in public administration.

\subsection*{Concentration Area Literature Review}

Students will complete a literature review in their concentration area as part of the MPA program's comprehensive exam requirement. The literature review will examine the practical and theoretical issues related to a specific public administration topic and synthesize the essential findings and debates in the literature. The literature review will allow students to deepen their knowledge of their concentration area and develop their research and writing skills. A peer review process will be used to provide feedback on the literature review, and students will have the opportunity to revise and resubmit their work based on the feedback received. Peer reviews will be conducted anonymously on \emph{Canvas}, and students will be assigned to review the work of their classmates.
