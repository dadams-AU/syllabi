\subsection*{Artificial Intelligence Policy}
\subsubsection*{Definitions of Generative AI}

\noindent For the purposes of this course, generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of producing human-like text, images, or other content. This includes, but is not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Large language models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4)
    \item Text-to-image generators (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)
    \item AI-powered writing assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)
    \item Automated content generators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{AI Use Policy}

In this course, the use of AI is permitted and encouraged as a learning tool, with the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Allowed}: Using AI for feedback on annotated bibliographies and syntheses, as outlined in the assignment.
    \item \textbf{Allowed}: Using AI for the optional reflection activity.
    \item \textbf{Not Allowed}: Submitting AI-generated content as your own work without substantial human input and critical analysis.
    \item \textbf{Not Mandatory}: The use of AI is optional. Students are not required to use AI tools if they prefer not to.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rationale for AI Policy}

This AI policy is designed to align with our course objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It supports the examination of public administration theories by encouraging critical engagement with AI feedback.
    \item It enhances literature review skills by allowing AI to provide additional perspectives on annotations and syntheses.
    \item It improves writing skills by providing an additional source of feedback and encouraging revision.
    \item It fosters critical thinking by requiring students to evaluate and incorporate AI feedback thoughtfully.
    \item It contributes to professional development by familiarizing students with AI tools they may encounter in their public administration careers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Guidance for Students on AI Use}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When using AI for feedback, always cite it as a source. For example: ``ChatGPT (Version X.X) [AI model]. OpenAI. Feedback received on [Date].''
    \item Be critical of AI-generated content. AI can make mistakes or provide biased information.
    \item Use AI as a tool to enhance your learning, not as a substitute for your own critical thinking and analysis.
    \item We will discuss ethical AI use and its implications for public administration during our course.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Repercussions for Policy Breaches}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suspected misuse of AI (e.g., submitting AI-generated content as your own without proper attribution) will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
    \item Detection methods may include inconsistencies in writing style, unusual phrasing, or content that doesn't align with the student's demonstrated knowledge and skills.
    \item Consequences for policy breaches may range from a required revision of the assignment to more severe academic integrity penalties, such as dismissal from the MPA program, depending on the nature and extent of the misuse.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Remember, the goal of this policy is to enhance your learning experience and prepare you for a future where AI will likely play a significant role in public administration. Use these tools responsibly and ethically to support your academic and professional growth.

\subsubsection*{Goals and Assessment of AI Use}

\noindent The goals for AI use in this course are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To teach students to use AI as a complementary tool for enhancing critical thinking and writing skills.
    \item To prepare students for professional environments where AI tools are increasingly common in public administration.
    \item To encourage critical evaluation of AI-generated feedback and content.
    \item To foster ethical and responsible use of AI in academic and professional settings.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Assessment of these goals and overall learning objectives will be conducted through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison of initial drafts with AI-assisted revisions
    \item Analysis of student reflections on the learning process
    \item Evaluation of class participation and discussions
    \item Periodic comparative assignments (with and without AI assistance)
    \item Review of AI usage logs
    \item Assessment of peer review quality
    \item Comprehensive final project or exam
    \item Professional development reflection on future AI use in public administration
\end{itemize}

\noindent These assessment methods will help ensure that AI use is enhancing, rather than replacing, critical thinking and analytical skills essential to public administration.

\section{Course Requirements}

\subsection*{1) Weekly Annotated Bibliography, Synthesis, and Reflection}

To facilitate class discussions and prepare you for comprehensive exams, your weekly writing assignment comprises two main components: an annotated bibliography of each weekly reading and a 2- to 3-page synthesis of the week's readings. You may also submit a personal reflection for bonus points. 

\subsubsection*{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Annotated Bibliography}: An annotated bibliography is an organized list of sources, similar to a reference list. Each source is followed by a brief (approximately 150 words) descriptive and evaluative paragraphâ€”the annotation. For this course:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Citation}: Provide a full citation in APA or Chicago author-date style.
    \item \textbf{Summary}: Summarize the central theme and key points in your own words.
    \item \textbf{Relevance}: Note the source's relevance to the week's topic and its implications for public administration.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The purpose is to review the literature on the week's topic, aiding in class discussions and developing your ability to distill and synthesize complex information.

\item \textbf{Synthesis}: A synthesis combines information from multiple sources to present a comprehensive understanding or argument. In this context, your sources are the weekly readings. The synthesis should:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify patterns and themes across readings;
    \item Draw connections between sources; and
    \item Address contradictions among sources or within individual readings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This critical analysis encourages deeper thinking about the readings and their implications for public administration theory and practice.

\item \textbf{Reflection} (Optional Bonus Activity): Reflection is a metacognitive practice that allows you to analyze your learning process, feedback received, and the evolution of your understanding of the week's topic. This activity is optional and offers bonus points. It involves self-assessment and promotes continuous improvement.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Assignment Details}

\textbf{Objectives}: Engage deeply with course readings, reflect on their implications for public administration, and collaborate with peers and AI to enhance analytical and writing skills.
\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent \textbf{Incorporating AI}: We'll use AI tools like ChatGPT to provide feedback on your assignments, aiming to refine your comprehension and writing skills. Remember, AI is a complementary tool to your critical thinking.
