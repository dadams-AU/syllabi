\section{Catalog Description}

	Federal domestic policymaking. Structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including executive, legislative and judicial branches, media, political parties, and pressure groups.

\section{Course Description}

	In this course, students will explore and engage in thoughtful discussions on the processes and key players in creating public policy in the United States. The curriculum focuses on the structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the media, political parties, and interest groups. We will examine the various official and unofficial influences on the policy process and the limitations imposed by institutional and structural factors.

    \vspace{1ex}

	\noindent This course delves into the historical and constitutional development of the policy process, as well as the distinct characteristics of public policy within a federal system. By understanding policy-making in the context of a constitutional republic and a federalized governance system, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities and uncertainties surrounding agenda setting, policy making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation in the American political system.

\section{Student Learning Objectives}

By the end of this course, students will be able to

\begin{enumerate}
	\item discuss and explain the key features of the public policy-making process in the United States;
	\item recognize and describe the distinct stages of the public policy process;
	\item describe the various internal and external actors that influence public policy, their interactions, and their impact on the policy process;
	\item articulate the historical and contemporary structures and institutions that facilitate, expand, or constrain the public policy process;
	\item differentiate and describe the various theories that attempt to explain the drivers and influences leading to public policy change or maintaining the status quo; and
	\item apply their knowledge of the policy process to analyze specific policy domains impacted by multiple policy actors and diverse elements of the policy process within the context of public policy-making in the United States.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{}Students are expected to plan ahead and manage their time effectively to ensure that assignments are submitted on time. If you are having trouble meeting a deadline, please contact the professor as soon as possible to discuss the situation.

\subsection*{Alternative Procedures for Submitting Work}
Students are expected to submit all assignments via \emph{Canvas}. If you cannot submit an assignment via \emph{Canvas}, please get in touch with the professor to discuss alternative submission procedures.

\subsection*{Retention of Student Work}
Students are responsible for retaining copies of all assignments submitted for this course. Students are also responsible for retaining copies of all graded assignments returned by the professor.

\subsection*{Extra Credit}
There is no extra credit available in this course. Students are expected to complete all assigned work to the best of their ability. Failure to complete assigned work may result in a failing grade for the course.

\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity. Any student found to have engaged in academic dishonesty will be subject to the sanctions described in the \href{https://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf}{Academic Dishonesty Policy} (UPS 300.021). Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, and submitting previously graded work without prior authorization. Students are expected to be familiar with the university's policy on academic dishonesty and to adhere to this policy in all aspects of this course. Any student who has questions about the policy should ask the professor for clarification.

\subsection*{Written Work}
All written work must be submitted in a professional format, including proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Written work must also be properly cited using the appropriate citation style. Students are expected to follow the guidelines for written work provided by the professor and to seek clarification if they have questions about the requirements. Assignments that do not meet these standards may be subject to point deductions or resubmission requirements.

\subsection*{Plagiarism}
Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity and will not be tolerated in this course. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, copying and pasting text from sources without proper citation, paraphrasing text from sources without proper citation, and submitting work that is not your own. Students are expected to properly cite all sources used in their work and to submit original work. Failure to do so may result in a failing grade for the assignment and further disciplinary action. Written work will be checked for plagiarism using plagiarism detection software. If you are unsure whether your work constitutes plagiarism, consult the professor before submitting.

\subsection*{AI-Generated Text and Tool Usage Policy}

\subsubsection*{Permissible Use of AI Tools}
\textbf{Definition of AI Tools:} In this course, AI tools refer to any software or platform that generates or assists in generating text, ideas, research references, or content creation. This includes, but is not limited to, large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, AI-based research tools like RefWorks or EndNote, and writing assistants like Grammarly.

\vspace{1ex}

\noindent\textbf{Permissible Use Cases:} Students are allowed to use AI tools for brainstorming, generating ideas, checking grammar, and summarizing content. However, AI tools should not be used to produce final drafts of assignments or significant portions of text that are submitted as original work. If AI tools are used, their contributions must be appropriately cited and disclosed.

\subsubsection*{Ethical Considerations}
\textbf{Academic Integrity:} The use of AI tools must adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity. This means that while these tools can support your work, they cannot replace your own analysis, critical thinking, and original writing. Misuse of AI-generated content is a form of academic dishonesty and will be treated as such under the university's policies.

\vspace{1ex}

\noindent\textbf{Required Disclosures:} Students must disclose their use of AI tools in any assignments. This disclosure should include a brief explanation of how the tool was used and how the student ensured the integrity of their work. For example, a note might state, “I used ChatGPT to generate initial ideas for this essay, but all writing and analysis are my own.”

\subsubsection*{Plagiarism and Originality}
\textbf{AI Detection Tools:} Assignments will be checked for originality using advanced AI detection software. Any submission found to contain unoriginal content generated by AI without proper citation will be subject to the university's academic dishonesty policy. Submitting AI-generated text as your own work, without attribution, is considered plagiarism.

\vspace{1ex}

\subsubsection*{Guidance and Resources}
\textbf{Ethical AI Usage Resources:} Students are encouraged to take advantage of available resources on responsible AI usage. This includes online tutorials, ethical guidelines, and citation practices. Workshops or additional materials on how to use AI tools responsibly may be provided throughout the course.

\vspace{1ex}

\noindent\textbf{Continuous Policy Review:} This AI policy will be reviewed and updated regularly to keep pace with technological advancements. Students are encouraged to provide feedback on this policy to ensure it aligns with their educational goals and the course's academic standards.

\subsubsection*{Example Scenarios}
\textbf{Acceptable Use:} A student uses Grammarly to check the grammar and clarity of their essay. The student does not need to disclose this use unless Grammarly significantly altered the content. Another student uses ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas but writes the essay independently, only citing the AI where directly quoted or paraphrased.

\vspace{1ex}

\noindent\textbf{Unacceptable Use:} A student uses ChatGPT to generate an entire essay and submits it as their own work without attribution. This would be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy and could result in a failing grade or further disciplinary action.

\subsection*{Participation}

Students are expected to participate in all course activities. This includes completing all assigned readings, watching all assigned videos, and participating in all discussions. Students are expected to participate in discussions in a professional and respectful manner. Students are expected to be familiar with the university policy on netiquette and to adhere to this policy in all aspects of this course. Any student who has questions about the policy should ask the professor for clarification. 

\subsection*{Netiquette}
Students are expected to adhere to the university's policy on netiquette. The university's policy on netiquette is as follows:
\begin{quote}Netiquette refers to a set of behaviors that are appropriate for online activity (e.g., social media, email, discussions, presentations). All personnel at Cal State Fullerton are expected to demonstrate appropriate online behavior at all times. A good summary of netiquette can be found in the \href{https://canvashelp.fullerton.edu/m/Student/l/1336786-student-what-is-netiquette}{CSUF Canvas self-help guides}, which adapts ten rules to the online course situation from the website for the book \href{http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html}{Netiquette by Virginia Shea} and other sources referenced at the bottom of the guide.\end{quote}
