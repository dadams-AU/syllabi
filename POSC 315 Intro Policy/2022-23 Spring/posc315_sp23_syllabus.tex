	\item \underline{Course Description:} \\
	In this class, students should be prepared to learn and thoughtfully discuss the processes and actors involved in making public policy in the United States. The focus is on the structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the media, political parties, and interest groups. The policy process is influenced in many ways, both officially and unofficially, and is restricted by various institutional and structural aspects. This course explores the historical and constitutional development of the policy process, as well as the unique nature of public policy in a federal system.  
	
	Understanding how policy is made within a constitutional republic with a federalized system of governance will allow students to appreciate better the nature of the American political system and the complexity and uncertainty of agenda setting, policy making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation.
		
	\item \underline{Student Learning Objectives:} 
	    \begin{enumerate}
	   		 \item Students will be able to discuss and explain general qualities of the policy process as it occurs in the United States.
		 
	   		 \item Students will be able to identify specific characteristics of the several ``stages'' of the policy process. 
		 
	   		 \item Students will be able to explain the numerous endogenous and exogenous actors who influence public policy, how they interact, and how they shape the policy process. 
		 
	   		 \item Students will be able to articulate the historical and contemporary structures and institutions which promote, expand, and/or constrict the policy process. 
	     
	   	     \item Students will be able to distinguish and articulate the differences between several theories that attempt to explain the mechanisms and influences which lead to policy change or ensure the status quo.
		 
	   		 \item Students will be able to apply their understanding of the policy process to specific policy domains that are affected by numerous policy actors and  various aspects of the policy process within the context United States public policy making. 
	   		\end{enumerate}

		\end{enumerate} 
	\end{multicols}

\item \underline{Graded Assignments and Examinations:} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{Three Examinations:} Three non-cumulative exams will assess students knowledge of course learning objectives and key concepts of American politics, public policy making and the policy process. Questions consist of 50 multiple choice questions. 
	
	\item \underline{Policy Term Paper:}Each student is expected to research and write on a specific public policy. The general idea of this paper is to discuss real-world public policy in terms of the concepts learned in class and through course readings. Additional details, instructions, and a grading rubric for this assignment will be provided during the second week of class. The final paper is due as indicated in the course schedule below. Students may choose any specific public policy, including court decisions, executive regulations, and legislative acts. Feel free to discuss the policy with Dr. Adams for feedback and suggestions during office hours. Begin thinking about your policy at the beginning of the semester so that you can relate course concepts to it throughout the term.

	\item \underline{Documentary Response Papers:} Two short documentary response papers will allow students to further explore concepts learned in class throughout the semester by discussing them in terms of a real-world policy domain. Additional details about this assignment will be provided during the second week of class. These papers should be \textit{no more} than 500 words of text and submitted as a \emph{Canvas} assignment prompt. 
	
	\item \underline{Policy Issue Analysis:} Throughout the semester we will discuss several recent public policy issues. These will come from Congressional Quarterly (CQ) Researcher's \href{https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/toc.php?mode=cqres-date&level=2&values=2022}{\emph{Issues for Debate in American Public Policy} 2022 edition}. Links to the issues will be provided on Canvas. These are accessible from CSUF computers or while on the campus wi-fi. You can download .pdf's while on campus to read while off campus. Students are expected about 250 words for each analysis.  
	
	\item \underline{Attendance and Participation:} Students are expected to attend each class meeting and participate in class discussions about relevant policy topics. Attendance will be taken each day the class meets and students are expected to participate in and contribute to discussions. Students may take two absences this semester without penalty. 
	
	\item \underline{Current Event Days:} On two days of class, as indicated in the schedule below, we will have \underline{no in-person class} session. These will be days specifically set aside to meet with the professor to discuss your policy paper topic. \href{https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/48008ba4b4ee4cb7bf1a0ba4fb62ae1a@Fullerton.edu?anonymous&ep=plink}{You can sign up here}. As well, a few current event topics will be linked to a canvas discussion post. Students can choose one or more current events to briefly discuss in terms of the course concepts in about a paragraph. Meaningful participation in the current event discussions will result in extra credit on the policy paper.

	
\end{itemize}

\item \underline{University Information:}

\begin{description}
	\item[Academic Honesty:] Academic dishonesty includes such things as cheating, inventing false information or citations, plagiarism, and helping someone else commit an act of academic dishonesty. It usually involves an attempt by a student to show a possession of a level of knowledge, which, in fact, the student does not possess. Cheating is defined as the act of obtaining or attempting to obtain credit for work by the use of any dishonest, deceptive, fraudulent, or unauthorized means. Plagiarism is defined as the act of taking the work of another and offering it as one's own without giving credit to that source. An instructor who believes that an act of academic dishonesty has occurred is (1) obliged to discuss the matter with the student(s) involved; (2) should possess reasonable evidence such as documents or personal observation; and (3) may take whatever action deemed appropriate, ranging from an oral reprimand to an F in the course. Additional information on this policy is available from the \href{http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS 300/UPS 300.021.pdf}{University Policy Statement 300.021}.
	
		\item[Accommodations for students with special needs:] Please inform the instructor during the first week of classes about any disability or special needs that you may have that may require specific arrangements related to attending class sessions, carrying out class assignments, or writing papers or examinations. Please do so by emailing the instructor to make an appointment to discuss your specific needs. According to California State University policy, students with disabilities must document their disabilities at the Disability Support Services (DSS) Office to be accommodated in their courses. Additional information can be found at the \href{http://www.fullerton.edu/dss}{DSS Website}, by calling 657-278-3112, or by emailing \href{mailto: dsservices@fullerton.edu}{dsservices@fullerton.edu}.
