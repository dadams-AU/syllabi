\section{Catalog Description}

	Federal domestic policymaking. Structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including executive, legislative and judicial branches, media, political parties, and pressure groups.

\section{Course Description}

	In this course, students will explore and engage in thoughtful discussions on the processes and key players in creating public policy in the United States. The curriculum focuses on the structure, functions, and relationships among American national institutions, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, the media, political parties, and interest groups. We will examine the various official and unofficial influences on the policy process and the limitations imposed by institutional and structural factors.

    \vspace{1ex}

	\noindent This course delves into the historical and constitutional development of the policy process, as well as the distinct characteristics of public policy within a federal system. By understanding policy-making in the context of a constitutional republic and a federalized governance system, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities and uncertainties surrounding agenda setting, policy making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation in the American political system.

\section{Student Learning Objectives}

By the end of this course, students will be able to

\begin{enumerate}
	\item discuss and explain the key features of the public policy-making process in the United States;
	\item recognize and describe the distinct stages of the public policy process;
	\item describe the various internal and external actors that influence public policy, their interactions, and their impact on the policy process;
	\item articulate the historical and contemporary structures and institutions that facilitate, expand, or constrain the public policy process;
	\item differentiate and describe the various theories that attempt to explain the drivers and influences leading to public policy change or maintaining the status quo; and
	\item apply their knowledge of the policy process to analyze specific policy domains impacted by multiple policy actors and diverse elements of the policy process within the context of public policy-making in the United States.
\end{enumerate}

Students are expected to check \emph{Canvas} and their email at least once daily.

\subsection*{Due Dates}
All assignments are due by 11:59 p.m. on the specified due date. Save for extenuating circumstances, late assignments will not be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made with the professor. Students are responsible for submitting assignments on time. Failure to submit an assignment on time may result in a failing grade for the assignment. 

\subsection*{Alternative Procedures for Submitting Work}
Students are expected to submit all assignments via \emph{Canvas}. If you cannot submit an assignment via \emph{Canvas}, please get in touch with the professor to discuss alternative submission procedures.

\subsection*{Retention of Student Work}
Students are responsible for retaining copies of all assignments submitted for this course. Students are also responsible for retaining copies of all graded assignments returned by the professor.

\subsection*{Extra Credit}
 There is one bonus assignment available in this course. A documentary analysis assignment will be available in Week 15. The assignment is optional and will provide extra credit points on the final exam. The assignment will be graded based on the quality of the analysis and the depth of engagement with the course material.

\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity. Any student found to have engaged in academic dishonesty will be subject to the sanctions described in the \href{https://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf}{Academic Dishonesty Policy} (UPS 300.021). Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, and submitting previously graded work without prior authorization. Students are expected to be familiar with the university's policy on academic dishonesty and to adhere to this policy in all aspects of this course. Any student who has questions about the policy should ask the professor for clarification.

\subsection*{Written Work}
All written work must be submitted in a professional format, including proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Written work must also be properly cited using the appropriate citation style. Students are expected to follow the guidelines for written work provided by the professor and to seek clarification if they have questions about the requirements.

\subsection*{Plagiarism}

Written work will be checked for plagiarism using plagiarism detection software.

\subsection*{AI Generated Text} 
Large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Opus 3, and others, have made it easier to generate text that mimics human writing. While these models can be useful for generating ideas and content, they can also be misused to produce work that is not original. Students are expected to use AI-generated text responsibly and to ensure that all work submitted in this course is their own. Failure to do so may result in a failing grade for the assignment and further disciplinary action. Written work will be checked for the use of AI-generated text using plagiarism detection software.
