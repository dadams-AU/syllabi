## Using the Repository

### Navigating the Repository

The repository is organized by course number and semester. Each course folder contains the LaTeX source file (`syllabus.tex`) and a compiled PDF (`syllabus.pdf`) for easy viewing.

### Customizing the Syllabi

To create your own syllabi using this format, use the `syllabus.tex` files in the `template` folder. These files are well-commented to help you understand and modify the LaTeX code. The `syllabus.pdf` files provide a visual reference for the final format.
