# CRJU/POSC 320: Scaffolded Policy Brief Assignment

## Administrative Challenges in Contemporary Government

### Overview

You will analyze one of three current public administration challenges through a 5-week scaffolded project using Google Docs with tracked changes. Each week builds on course concepts and requires specific integration with your Kettl textbook. By the end of Week 5, you will have created a professional policy brief demonstrating your understanding of public administration theory and practice.

**Total Project Value: 45% of course grade**
**Research Logs: 10% of course grade (graded separately)**

**Policy Brief Project Grade Breakdown:**

- Week 1: 10% of Policy Brief grade (Problem Statement & Research Foundation)
- Week 2: 15% of Policy Brief grade (Stakeholder Analysis & Context)
- Week 3: 20% of Policy Brief grade (Organizational Theory Application)
- Week 4: 25% of Policy Brief grade (Management Challenges & Solutions)
- Week 5: 30% of Policy Brief grade (Final Recommendations & Polish)

**Research Log Grading:**
Each weekly Research Log is worth 2% of your total course grade (5 weeks Ã— 2% = 10% total). Research Logs are evaluated on evidence of genuine engagement with sources, reflection on learning process, and connection to course concepts.
