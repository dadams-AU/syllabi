\section{Catalog Description}

Introduces public administration through current trends and problems of public sector agencies in such areas as organization behavior, public budgeting, personnel, planning and policy making. Examples and cases from the Criminal Justice field. (POSC 320 and CRJU 320 are the same course.)

\section{Course Description}

Public administration plays an important role in our everyday lives. What do public administrators do? What makes this important field of government work? How are decisions made and how does the political environment impact those decisions? Our public administrators have to respond to various demands from United States residents and deal with situations and demands from abroad. The values we share interact and compete for the way our administrators create and implement policy. The core values of public administration include accountability, efficiency, and equity. We'll explore these topics and more as we engage in our class together. 

\vspace*{1em}

\noindent This course is an introduction to the study and practice---the science and art---of public administration. Students will be acquainted with the theoretical and practical aspects of public administration in the American political setting. Topics include organizational theory and practice, decision making, systems analysis, performance evaluation, and administrative and managerial improvement, among others. The emphasis is placed on understanding the roles and responsibilities of public administrators in a democratic political system.
